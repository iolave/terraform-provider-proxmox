### Nested Schema for `rules`

You can also specify an address range like '20.34.101.207-201.3.9.99', or a list of IP addresses and networks (entries are separated by comma). Please do not mix IPv4 and IPv6 addresses inside such lists.
- `dport` (String) Restrict TCP/UDP destination port. You can use service names or simple numbers (0-65535), as defined in '/etc/services'. Port ranges can be specified with '\d+:\d+', for example '80:85', and you can use comma separated list to match several ports or ranges.
- `enable` (Boolean) Flag to enable/disable a rule.
- `icmp_type` (String) Specify icmp-type. Only valid if proto equals 'icmp' or 'icmpv6'/'ipv6-icmp'.
